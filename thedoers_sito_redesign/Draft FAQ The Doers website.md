## WHAT ARE YOUR RESOURCES?
We have multiple tools in our pocket to take personal care of the majority of your needs. From graphic identity to IA and web development using different technologies (...). We have a good network of connections that we can put at your disposal for implementation or financial support. And of course our best resources are our experience, time and effort.

## HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FROM THE START TO BE FULLY OPERATIVE?


## HOW DO YOU EVALUATE AND SELECT THE START-UPS TO FOLLOW?
For us is very important to meet the people not just the idea. That's why we always encourage to drop us a line and meet personally over an informal lunch so you can present us your project.
The evaluation process starts there, understanding together limits and opportunities, according to the information you provide us with, our experience and network of connections, an eager exploration of the matter and a little bit of gut feeling. 


## HOW MUCH WILL MY PROJECT COST?

## WHAT IS YOUR SCALE OF INTERVENTION?
Each start-up have a different scale of intervention according to the project itself, the resources available and the strategy that we agreed to follow. We operate to a local, national and international level following the start-up needs and advising you on the feasability of a project one step at the time: better a small success than a big crash.
