#1-THE RWD

##25 maggio 2010

> Responsive design is not about ‘designing for mobile’. But it’s not about ‘designing for the desktop’, either. Rather, it’s about adopting a more flexible, device-agnostic approach to designing for the web. 

##### John Allsopp 
##### “A Dao of Web Design”


[t]he control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must “accept the ebb and flow of things.” Now, John was writing during the web’s early years, a period of transition when designers transferred print-centered design principles onto this young, new medium.

## ELEMENTS OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN

1. A flexible, grid-based layout
3. Flexible images and media
5. Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification

## MOBILE-ONLY ACCESS
Others have shown that 25% of US internet users are mobile-only, meaning they never or rarely access the internet via laptop or desktop computers (source – Alistair Hill – On Device Research )

* That means more people will be using mobile devices to access the web than those getting online with desktops and laptops. This transition has already started. Home usage of personal computers in 2010 was down 20% from 2008 in the United States. The culprit? Smartphones and tablets gobbling up our time online. 

* Traffic to mobile websites in 2010 grew 600% after tripling between 2009 and 2010 

* And it’s only going to get bigger. While half a billion people accessed the mobile internet worldwide in 2009, heavy mobile data users will triple to one billion by 2013

#4. ALLIGN WITH THE MOBILE BEHAVIOUR

* Lookup/Find (urgent info, local): I need an answer to some- thing now—frequently related to my current location in the world.

* Explore/Play (bored, local): I have some time to kill and just want a few idle time distractions.

* Check In/Status (repeat/micro-tasking): Something important to me keeps changing or updating and I want to stay on top of it. 

* Edit/Create (urgent change/micro-tasking): I need to get some- thing done now that can’t wait.

#5. IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT WEB, IS ABOUT CONTENT

##RESPONSIVE EMAILS
> As further proof, consider that in November 2010 visitors to web-based email sites declined 6%, but visitors accessing email with their mobile devices grew by 36%. 

* Inline style 

* No font support 

* Min and max device with media queries 

* Use just few images 

* Create the plain text email

## STOP USING CAPTCHA FOR SPAM CONTROL

The onus for stopping spam should not fall on your legitimate visitors. Making it more difficult for real people to sign up for an account, request information, or otherwise fill out a form on your site is not worth the trade-off. The burden of spam control should fall squarely on the shoulders of the site owner, and not on the site visitor. Find a new way to control spam, preferably through better filtering and back-end management. This is not the first time a change like this has been proposed, but it’s time that it start being more widely adopted by the design community.
