> Responsive design is not about ‘designing for mobile’. But it’s not about ‘designing for the desktop’, either. Rather, it’s about adopting a more flexible, device-agnostic approach to designing for the web. 

##### John Allsopp 
##### “A Dao of Web Design”


[t]he control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must “accept the ebb and flow of things.” Now, John was writing during the web’s early years, a period of transition when designers transferred print-centered design principles onto this young, new medium.
