#1-THE RWD

##25 maggio 2010

> Responsive design is not about ‘designing for mobile’. But it’s not about ‘designing for the desktop’, either. Rather, it’s about adopting a more flexible, device-agnostic approach to designing for the web. 

##### John Allsopp 
##### “A Dao of Web Design”


[t]he control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must “accept the ebb and flow of things.” Now, John was writing during the web’s early years, a period of transition when designers transferred print-centered design principles onto this young, new medium.

# ELEMENTS OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN

1. A flexible, grid-based layout
3. Flexible images and media
5. Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification

# MOBILE-ONLY ACCESS
Others have shown that 25% of US internet users are mobile-only, meaning they never or rarely access the internet via laptop or desktop computers (source – Alistair Hill – On Device Research )

* That means more people will be using mobile devices to access the web than those getting online with desktops and laptops. This transition has already started. Home usage of personal computers in 2010 was down 20% from 2008 in the United States. The culprit? Smartphones and tablets gobbling up our time online. 

* Traffic to mobile websites in 2010 grew 600% after tripling between 2009 and 2010 

* And it’s only going to get bigger. While half a billion people accessed the mobile internet worldwide in 2009, heavy mobile data users will triple to one billion by 2013
