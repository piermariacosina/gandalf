# Our golden rules (investment criteria)
1. The entrepreneur has	to prove strong leadership,	vision and	passion	
2. The market you are adressing has to be huge	
3. Look at profitability!
4. The right team on board (need people to push, hire slow and fire fast)

# How does a Venture Capital protects its minority	position ?
### VCs typically take a minority stake in the company. Standard protection tools in the industry	are:

* Preferred versus ordinary shares
* Liquidation preference: participating and non-participating
* Anti-­dilution clauses: full ratchet	or weighted average
* Corporate governance rules	

# How does	a VC	make sure	that its targets are reached?	
### VC exit target is	to be negotiated	 when the deal is closed

* Exit Emeframe	
* Tag along	
* Drag along	
### Other standard characteristics of a VC deal:
* Internal investors partecipation
* Preferred dividends
* Rights in future rounds	
* Rights of first refusal	
* Information rights	
* Management salary and commitment

# How a fund is structured	

### Typical 100 M fund 
### 20 M	mgt fee, 5­‐10 M	extra reserves, implies 75-­80M invested max
### 20 investments,	2­‐4M	per deal initial investment, 4M average over	 severall rounds	
### Hurdle rate 7%,	6 years average	holding period	=> “positive return” for the	team	 means above 150 M	

### Target IRR of fund investors is 10-­15% net of carried interest    => happy investors needs total return above approx. 225 M	
* ### below 2x, we actually	 “lose money”, 3x is a positive contributor to fund objective, need 5x and 10x to compensate for bad investments
