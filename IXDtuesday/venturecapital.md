# Impact on	the real economy of VC investing

## A recent survey on a selected number	 of VC-­‐backed french companies in the digital industry has proved that:	

* VC investing generates employment growth	(not true for the rest of the economy!!) and better quality (full time vs temporary contracts) than SMEs on average
* VC backed companies hire	 younger people	 on average (31 years) and almost 13% of hirings	 are straight out	of college		
* VC backed companies invest more in	R&D	(2 Emes average SME) and	are more internationally oriented	(40%	of turnover)

# Our golden rules (investment criteria)
1. The entrepreneur has	to prove strong leadership,	vision and	passion	
2. The market you are adressing has to be huge	
3. Look at profitability!
4. The right team on board (need people to push, hire slow and fire fast)

# How does a Venture Capital protects its minority	position ?
### VCs typically take a minority stake in the company. Standard protection tools in the industry	are:

* Preferred versus ordinary shares
* Liquidation preference: participating and non-participating
* Anti-­dilution clauses: full ratchet	or weighted average
* Corporate governance rules	

# How does	a VC	make sure	that its targets are reached?	
### VC exit target is	to be negotiated	 when the deal is closed

* Exit Emeframe	
* Tag along	
* Drag along	
### Other standard characteristics of a VC deal:
* Internal investors partecipation
* Preferred dividends
* Rights in future rounds	
* Rights of first refusal	
* Information rights	
* Management salary and commitment

# How an early stage fund makes money

* 20 deals:	
* 1 Blockbuster, 20x=80 M	
* 1 star, 10x	=40 M	
* 2 successes, 5x=2x20M=40 M	
* 4 average,	 2­‐3X	=4x10M=40 M	
* 6 bad investments:0,5-­2x=	20 M	
* 6 write offs	

* Total	: 220	 M, net IRR to investors 12%, carried interest 20‐25 M (for 12 years’ worth of	 work)	
* ### On any given investment, 10x must be possible
* In a successful fund, fund managers make less money than successful entrepreneurs, which is normal,	similar to average entrepreneur	
* NB:	FCPI/ISF funds are different
